#Pop Method used to remove the last element in the array. 

let item = sample.pop()

#to remove first element in array 
>>shift method is used

#to add the element at the start
>>unshift method is used.

#To merge an array
>>concat method is used : when u use concate method it create a new array having content from both the array. 
eg: let array1 = ["Apple", "Mango", "Gapes"]
	let array2 = ["Pear", "JackFruit", "Strawberry"]
	array1 = array1.concat(array2)
	console.log(array1)

#To add the element at particular position
>>splice method is used
arr1.splice(2, 0, "Raju");
here 2 is a index where we need to add the element 0 means no deletion or overriding and raju is an element.

#To delete the element at particular position
>>splice(1,1);
here 1 means the index we want to delete and the next 1 is the number of element we want to get delete from that index. 
{splice( start-index, qunatity to delete, stuff to add)}

#To undate the array we can use 

eg:  let arr1 = [ "Shayam", "Baburao", "Raju"]
       arr1[0]="SHYAAM"
       console.log(arr1)

To cut the array in 2 pieces we use
>>slice method 
eg: let arr1 = ["Rohit", "krishna", "Mohit","Shayam", "Baburao", "Akash"];
        let data = arr1.slice(2,4){Where 2  is the starting element of array slice till 4th element(Exclusive)}
        console.log(data)
        console.log(arr1)
        This cut the 2nd and 3rd element or arr1 and create a new array . 
The slice method does no change the orginal array but it just make new array from the original one and need to store in new variable. 

#To get date and time in js
eg: let currentdate = new Date();
      console.log(currentdate);
      console.log(currentdate.toDateString());
      console.log(currentdate.toUTCString());
      console.log(currentdate.toISOString());
#To get more date formats:
eg: /*Formats in Dates*/
      let date1 = new Date("jan 1 2023");
      console.log(date1);
      let date2 = new Date("January 24 2023 13:34:45");
      console.log(date2);

#To get current date:
eg:  let date = new Date();
      console.log("Year:",date.getFullYear());
      console.log("Month:",date.getMonth());
      console.log("Hour:",date.getHours());
      console.log("day:",date.getDay());
      console.log(date.getUTCMilliseconds());
    

#To get Current day:
eg: console.log(d.toLocaleString("en-us", { weekday: "long" }));
