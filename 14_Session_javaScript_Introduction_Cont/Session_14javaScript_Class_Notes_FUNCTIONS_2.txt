<<FUNCTIONS_IN_JAVACRIPT>>

Functions are basically used to give names to lines of code.
Thus by using function, we can get code reusability.
Code reusability helps in maintainance of project. 

JavaScript can be run in 2 ways:
1. With browser 	2. Without browser
1. With browser: with in browser we have a program called as DOM. DOM stands for Document Object Model. This is a program with in browser to undestand the HTML and JS. When we use js in browser, we get many inbuilt objects in browser. like document , windows etc using which we can perform many operations.

>>Alert is an inbuilt javaScript DOM based  object which pop up an alert when clicked. 

Elements can be fetch by using method called getElementById 
eg: let enterName = document.getElementById("myname").value;
