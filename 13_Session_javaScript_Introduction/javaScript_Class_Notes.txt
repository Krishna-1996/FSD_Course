***<<javaScript_Class_Notes>>***

>>js is an object oriented programming lang.
>>js can work on browser. it can also work without browser.
>>To run a js program without browser we need nodeJs install. 
>> js can be used to create front-end as well as back-end programs. 
>> To use js within browser(HTML) we make use of script tag <script></script>.

#console.log("is used to print anything on screen")
>>Variables: are used to store data. js is 'loose type' prog langauge. So a same variable can hold different data at different time. 
In JS we can create variable in using let and var..
>>var n1 = 30//By var
>>let n2 = 40 // By let
const is another way to give variables
        const Pi = 3.14
        console.log(Pi)
        // const Pi = 2.24
        // console.log(Pi)Cant chang the value of const
We cant change the value of variable in const. 
>> Relational Operators are used to check for equality greater than or less than 

{var n1 = 30
    var n2 = 25
    console.log("==",n1==n2)//equal
    console.log(">",n1>n2)//greater
    console.log("<",n1<n2)//less than
    console.log(">=",n1>=n2)//greater than equal
    console.log("<=",n1<=n2)//less than equal
    console.log("!=",n1!=n2)//not equal}
