***<<javaScript_Class_Notes>>***
#Intro
>>js is an object oriented programming lang.
>>js can work on browser. it can also work without browser.
>>To run a js program without browser we need nodeJs install. 
>> js can be used to create front-end as well as back-end programs. 
>> To use js within browser(HTML) we make use of script tag <script></script>.

console.log("is used to print anything on screen")

#Variables: 
>>Are used to store data. js is 'loose type' prog langauge. 
>>So a same variable can hold different data at different time. 
>>In JS we can create variable in using let and var..
eg: 	var n1 = 30//By var
	let n2 = 40 // By let
const is another way to give variables
eg:        const Pi = 3.14
        console.log(Pi)
        // const Pi = 2.24
        // console.log(Pi)Cant chang the value of const
We cant change the value of variable in const. 

#Relational Operators
>> Relational Operators are used to check for equality greater than or less than 
eg: var n1 = 30
    var n2 = 25
    console.log("==",n1==n2)//equal
    console.log(">",n1>n2)//greater
    console.log("<",n1<n2)//less than
    console.log(">=",n1>=n2)//greater than equal
    console.log("<=",n1<=n2)//less than equal
    console.log("!=",n1!=n2)//not equal

#Ternary Operatior: the syntex of ternarry operatr is as below:
>>(condition)?(true):(false)
we give a condition ... if condition is true it will go like the way true  and vice versa.
eg:  let n1 = 10 
        let n2 = 20
        let output = n1>n2?/*condition*/"n1 is greater"/*If condition is true*/:"n2 is greater"/*if condition id false*/
        console.log(output)

let output = n1 > n2? 
		n1 > n3 ? 
		n1:n3
		: 
		n2 > n3?
		n2:n3

#if...else condition.
if is loop it will tak a condition . 
if(condition){ if condition is true
//statement that execute
}
else{ if condition is false

}

#Repetitive loop
#For loop: for loop has 3 parts, 1: intialization, 2: condition, 3: increment(i++)inc by 1 or decrement.(i--)dec by1
for loop will keep on repeating till the condition is false. 
eg: for(i=1;i<=10;i++)
        {
            console.log(5,"*",i,"=",5*i)
        }

#While loop: while loop is also repetitive loop. In while loop we have only condition. Till the condition is true while loop will keep repeting. 
eg: let i = 1;
      while (i <= 10) {
        console.log(5, "*", i, "=", i * 5);
        i++;
      }

#Array: Array is basically used whenever u want to store one than one values. 
>>Array is basically allow us to access the value by suing index. 
>>Index of an array starts with 0. 
>>In JS we create an array by using [ ]
>>We can add, delete and update the elements in an array.
