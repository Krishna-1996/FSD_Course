<< SESSION_19_NOTES >>

Objects: they are currespond to real world entities, eg: student object correspond to real world student. 
Any object will have attributes/properties (data) and functions(methods) which works on data. 
Thus combination of properties and fucntion are known as Objects

eg: student Objects:
    properties are:
        name 
        age
        rollNo
        address....

    Methods are:
        student study
        student play
        student travel
        student drink......

In javaScript objects and arrays are related. 
Arrays ahev fixed index strating from 0, in javaScript index is the property name. 
in js you can create an empty objet by using {}.

To simplify the process of creating the object, javaScript make use of classes. 
A class is a template using which we can create objects with predefined attribute and fucntion.
There are 2 ways to creating an objects in javaScript:
    1. Premitive way: using functions//Object2.html
        

    2. Class Oriented way: using class //Object3.html

    When we creat an object using any of the above 2 methods we have to  req a keyword 'new'.
    keywords are words which have predefined meaning in the programming language.


    Ques1: create a calculator class which will contain function to perform addition subs multi and division. 

>> Inheritence: It is a property of Object Orientness. It is a property in which a class can get properties and functions from another class. 
for eg: employee and manager. here we have  a relationship known as ease-a-relationship. (manager is also an employee)
        machine and car . (car is a machine)

JavaScript supports object oreited-ness with the help of 'extend' keyword.
