https://notepad.pw/a1ahcTuB0EAqLbrXZY0k


The aim of CSS is to allow the formatting of HTML. Thus CSS deal with look and feel. We can define CSS with the help of style tag 
<style>
TO format a tag 
tagname{
css properties;

}
</style>
eg:
p{
color: red;}

>>id
>>id is an attribute which can be given to an HTML element. While giving ID we have to ensure that it is not duplicated in a page. 
and in style we use # to denote ID 

<style>
        #para{
            color:blue;
        }
    </style>

    <p id="para">
        This is krishna
    </p>
    <p>
        This is another para.
    </p>


>>class
IN CSS we have a class concept which is used to apply our css to different element. 
.class notation is used to apply this in style tag . 
div tag provide container to other tag .

>>padding adjust the content within the component while margin adjust the component from the borders of the browser.

>>height : In html we can define the height and width in term of pixal or percentage 
Percentage is more preferred since, the values are calculated dynamically 

>>BOX_Model: Box model means content + model + border + margin 
>> If u want to ristrict a class from being used in one tag we use tagname.classname and to control the look of list we make list style type 

>> pseudo classes are classes which are used wen we used for tool tip eg: hover etc
>>CSS can be used in HTML in 3 ways:
1. Inline: within the HTML tag (least Preferred)
2. Internal: in the head tag by applying <style> tag
3 External: using .css file from outside or creating new field for CSS. (most preferred)
<internal overriding by external style  overriding by inline style>

>>animation : CSS also support animation like change color. changing location and backgroud and it make use of key frames.

Animation is define in keyframs and porperties in div tag
It also have percentage.
