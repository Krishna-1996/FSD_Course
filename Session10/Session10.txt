<**Recap GIT**>
Git is a distributed VCS. Its major aim is to act as code repository. 
GIT maintains two repo- 
1. Local repo	2. Remote repo.

Step 1: Create remote repo
Step 2: Clone that repo.( >>git clone http: url)
Step3: To see the branches available. (>>git branch -a)
Step4: See current branch by (>>git branch)
Step5: If u want to change th branch u can do it (>>git checkout branch_name )
Step6: U can make changes in the file as req. to see which file have changed we can make use of (>>git status )
Step7: U can add the files (>>git add ) to add all files
Step8: All the changes done till now are in stagging area. If u want to make the changes in the repo, u have to make use of (>>git commit -m "message")
Step9: The commit which is done is in local repo. If u wan to make the changes in remote repo, then (>>git push).
NOTES:
>>git fetch : to get latest branches.
>>git pull : to get all the latest changes in the local from remote.
merge comflict can occur, whenever two diff developer make changes in the same line of code. We will have to resolve this conflict to check again .
